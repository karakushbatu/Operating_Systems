# üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems Lab

This repository contains my lab work, projects, and simulations related to Operating Systems concepts.  
Developed as part of my coursework at **Istanbul Technical University ‚Äì Computer Engineering**.

## üìÇ Structure

- `cpu-scheduling/`: Simulations for FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling
- `memory-management/`: Paging, segmentation, and allocation strategies
- `synchronization/`: Classic problems like Producer-Consumer and Dining Philosophers
- `file-system/`: Simple file system simulations and file table management
- `process-control/`: Process creation, termination, fork-exec style simulations

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- `C` for simulations and logic
- `POSIX threads (pthreads)` for synchronization
- `ASCII terminal visualizations` (for showing execution timelines, etc.)

---

## üìö Topics Covered

- Process scheduling and dispatching
- Memory allocation strategies
- Thread synchronization and race conditions
- File system management
- Process lifecycle and context switching
